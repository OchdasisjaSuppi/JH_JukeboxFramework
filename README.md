# A mod framework for Jupiter Hell
This framework can be used to add custom music to Jupiter Hell.
Listen to your favortie music while playing Jupiter Hell.

## Music File Format
The game uses the Ogg-Format for music files.

## Music Documentation
I added more documentation to the Sound.lua file to help identify where the music file is used in the game.

## Install
Create a mods folder in your Jupiter Hell game directory if it doesn't exist, then add the folder there.
For Mac users, navigate to your Jupiter Hell app, right click, select "show package contents", navigate to Contents > MacOS, and put the downloaded mod folder into mods folder found there.

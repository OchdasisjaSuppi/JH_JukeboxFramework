# A mod framework for Jupiter Hell
This framework can be used to add custom music to Jupiter Hell.<br/>
I added more documentation to the Sound.lua file to help identify where the music files are used in the game.

## Music File Format
The game uses the Ogg Vorbis format for music files.

## How to convert your music to *.ogg
I recomand using the free software [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to do so.
